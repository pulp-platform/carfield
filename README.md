# Carfield

Carfield is a mixed-criticality SoC targeting the automotive domain. It uses
[`Cheshire`](https://github.com/pulp-platform/cheshire) as main host domain.

Carfield is developed as part of the PULP project, a joint effort between ETH Zurich and the
University of Bologna.

## Motivation

The rapid evolution of AI algorithms, the massive amount of sensed data and the pervasive influence
of AI-enhanced applications across application-domains such as Automotive, Space and Cyber-Physical
embedded systems (CPSs), call for a paradigm shift from simple micro-controllers towards powerful
and heterogeneous edge computers in the design of **next generation of mixed-criticality systems
(MCSs)**. These must not only deliver outstanding performance and energy efficiency but also ensure
steadfast safety, resilience, and security.

The Carfield platform aims to tackle these architectural challenges establishing itself as a
pre-competitive heterogeneous platform for MCSs, underpinned by fully open-source Intellectual
Properties (IPs). Carfield showcases pioneering hardware solutions, addressing challenges related to
time-predictable on/off-chip communication, robust fault recovery mechanisms, secure boot processes,
cryptographic acceleration services, hardware-assisted virtualization, and accelerated computation
for both floating-point and integer workloads.

## Quick Start

* To learn how to build and use Carfield, see [Getting
  Started](https://pulp-platform.github.io/carfield/gs/).
* To learn about available simulation, FPGA, and ASIC targets, see
  [Targets](https://pulp-platform.github.io/carfield/tg).
* For detailed information on Carfield's inner workings, consult the [User
  Manual](https://pulp-platform.github.io/carfield/um/).

If you are impatient and have all needed
[dependencies](https://pulp-platform.github.io/carfield/gs/#dependencies), you can run:

```
make car-all
```

and then run a [simulation](https://pulp-platform.github.io/carfield/tg/sim) by typing:

```
make car-hw-build car-hw-sim CHS_BINARY=./sw/tests/bare-metal/hostd/helloworld.car.l2.elf
```
