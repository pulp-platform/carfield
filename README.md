# Carfield

Carfield is a mixed-criticality SoC targeting the automotive domain. It uses
[`Cheshire`](https://github.com/pulp-platform/cheshire) as main host domain.

Carfield is developed as part of the PULP project, a joint effort between ETH Zurich and the
University of Bologna.

## Quick Start

* To learn how to build and use Carfield, see [Getting
  Started](https://pulp-platform.github.io/carfield/gs/).
* To learn about available simulation, FPGA, and ASIC targets, see
  [Targets](https://pulp-platform.github.io/carfield/tg).
* For detailed information on Cheshire's inner workings, consult the [User
  Manual](https://pulp-platform.github.io/carfield/um/).

If you are impatient and have all needed
[dependencies](https://pulp-platform.github.io/carfield/gs/#dependencies), you can run:

```
make car-init
```

and then run a [simulation](https://pulp-platform.github.io/carfield/tg/sim) by typing:

```
make car-hw-build car-hw-sim CHS_BINARY ./sw/tests/bare-metal/hostd/helloworld.car.l2.elf
```
