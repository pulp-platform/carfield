# Carfield

This repository hosts the Carfield SoC platform, a mixed-criticality SoC
targeting the automotive domain. It uses
[`Cheshire`](https://github.com/pulp-platform/cheshire) as main host domain. It
is developed as part of the PULP project, a joint effort between ETH Zurich and
the University of Bologna.

## Disclaimer

This project is still considered to be in early development; some parts may not
yet be functional, and existing interfaces and conventions may be broken without
prior notice. We target a formal release in the very near future.
