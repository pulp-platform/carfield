# Logic synthesis and physical implementation

Currently, synthesis of Carfield is available with closed source tools, and hence its scripts are
added in the `nonfree` repository mentioned in the [Getting Started](../gs.md) section.

Once open-EDA and open-PDK flow is available, it will be updated in this page.

For independent synthesis of carfield by external users, we provide a wrapper under
`target/synth/carfield_synth_wrap.sv`.

### Memory requirements for physical implementation

Given Carfield's complexity and heterogeneity, in the following we provide an overview of Carfield's
on-chip memory requirements to help ASIC developers who wants to implement Carfield or integrate it
into larger platforms.
